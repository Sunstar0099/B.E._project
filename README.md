## Introduction

The power system is a complex network that converts various forms of energy into electrical power. It involves components like generators, transformers, circuit breakers, and conductors. Fault location in this system is critical for timely fault clearance and system reliability.

## Challenges in Fault Location

Locating faults in transmission lines (TL) presents challenges due to factors like changing environmental conditions, network parameter variations, and system complexity. Various algorithms have been developed to address these challenges, including:

- Adaptive Phasor Measurement Unit
- Artificial Neural Network
- Discrete Wavelet Transform
- Pseudorandom Binary Sequence
- Impedance-Based Methods
- Traveling Waves
- Support Vector Machine
- Computational Intelligence Approaches

However, each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, and not all are suitable for systems with compensation.

## Simulation
